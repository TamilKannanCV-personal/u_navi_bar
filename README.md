## Usage

`UNaviBar` behaves exactly like `BottomNavigationBar`. But the difference is its style and theme which is similar to **Material You**.
```dart
UNaviBar(items: [
    UNaviBarItem(context, icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: "Home"),        
    UNaviBarItem(context, icon: Icon(Icons.settings), label: "Settings"),
]),
```
